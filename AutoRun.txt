Configure Auto-Start
With the software now tested “manually,” let’s make it start automatically upon booting:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Before the final “exit 0” line, add these two lines:
    cd /home/pi/Python-Thermal-Printer
    python main.py &

If you downloaded or otherwise placed the printer software in a different location, the first line should be changed accordingly. “sudo” isn’t necessary here because the rc.local script is already run as root.

Reboot the system to test the startup function:

sudo reboot

After 30 seconds to a minute, you should see the status light come on. After another 30 seconds, the greeting image should be printed, then the “once daily” functions. After that, the printer will go into Twitter-monitoring mode.
