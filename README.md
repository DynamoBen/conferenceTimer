# conferenceTimer

This is a speakers timer and on-air light intended for confernces that are livestreamed. 
I got the idea from this blog post: http://blog.la1tv.co.uk/2014/05/pi-clock/

This combines two projects:
* Clock Project: https://github.com/Engineeringradio/pirsclockfull
* Webserver: http://electronicsbyexamples.blogspot.com/2014/02/raspberry-pi-control-from-mobile-device.html

Both of the above projects form the foundation of the finished project.

Enjoy!
